                    man-made wonder in 2016), and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was designed by English engineers
                    Sir
                    John Fowler and Sir
                    Benjamin Baker. It is sometimes referred to as the Forth Rail Bridge (to distinguish it from the
                    adjacent Forth Road Bridge),
                    although this has never been its official name.<img src="IMAGES/forth bridge.jpg"

                    Construction of the bridge began in 1882 and it was opened on 4 March 1890 by the Duke of Rothesay,
                    the
                    future Edward VII.
                    The bridge carries the Edinburgh–Aberdeen line across the Forth between the villages of South
                    Queensferry and North
                    Queensferry and has a total length of 8,094 feet (2,467 m). When it opened it had the longest single
                    cantilever bridge
                    span in the world, until 1919 when the Quebec Bridge in Canada was completed. It continues to be the
                    world's second-longest
                    single cantilever span, with a span of 1,709 feet (521 m).

                Before the construction of the bridge, ferries were used to cross the Firth. In 1806, a pair
                of tunnels, one for each
                direction, was proposed, and in 1818 James Anderson produced a design for a three-span suspension bridge
                close to the site of the present
                one. Calling for approximately 2,500 tonnes (2,500 long tons; 2,800 short tons) of iron, Wilhelm
                Westhofen said of it "and this quantity
                distributed over the length would have given it a very light and slender appearance, so light indeed
                that on a dull day it would
                hardly have been visible, and after a heavy gale probably no longer to be seen on a clear day either".
                <br>
                For the railway age, Thomas Bouch designed for the Edinburgh and Northern Railway a roll-on/roll-off
                ferry between Granton and
                Burntisland that opened in 1850, which proved so successful that another was ordered for the Tay.[9] In
                late 1863, a joint
                project between the North British Railway and Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, which would merge in 1865,
                appointed Stephenson
                and Toner to design a bridge for the Forth, but the commission was given to Bouch around six months
                later.
                <br>
                It had proven difficult to engineer a suspension bridge that was able to carry railway traffic, and
                Thomas Bouch, engineer to
                the North British Railway (NBR) and Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, was in 1863–1864 working on a
                single-track girder bridge
                crossing the Forth near Charlestown, where the river is around 2 miles (3.2 km) wide, but mostly
                relatively shallow.
                The promoters, however, were concerned about the ability to set foundations in the silty river bottom,
                as borings had gone as
                deep as 231 feet (70 m) into the mud without finding any rock, but Bouch conducted experiments to
                demonstrate that it was
                possible for the silt to support considerable weight.

                    the
                    bridge was passed on
                    19 May 1882 after an eight-day enquiry, the only objections being from rival railway companies. On
                    21
                    December,
                    the contract was let to Sir Thomas Tancred, Mr. T. H. Falkiner and Mr. Joseph Philips, civil
                    engineers
                    and contractor,
                    and Sir William Arrol & Co.. Arrol was a self-made man, who had been apprenticed to a blacksmith at
                    the
                    age of
                    thirteen before going on to have a highly successful business. Tancred was a professional engineer
                    who
                    had worked
                    with Arrol before, but he would leave the partnership during the course of construction.
                    <br>
                    The new works took possession of offices and stores erected by Arrol in connection with Bouch's
                    bridge;
                    these were expanded
                    considerably over time. Reginald Middleton took an accurate survey to establish the exact position
                    of the bridge and allow
                    the permanent construction work to commence.
                    <br>
                    The preparations at South Queensferry were much more substantial, and required the steep hillside to
                    be
                    terraced.
                    Wooden huts and shops for the workmen were put up, as well as more substantial brick houses for the
                    foremen and tenements
                    for leading hands and gangers. Drill roads and workshops were built, as well as a drawing loft 200
                    by 60
                    feet (61 by 18 m)
                    to allow full size drawings and templates to be laid out. A cable was also laid across the Forth to
                    allow telephone
                    communication between the centres at South Queensferry, Inchgarvie, and North Queensferry, and
                    girders
                    from the collapsed
                    Tay Bridge were laid across the railway to the west in order to allow access to the ground there.
                    Near
                    the shore a sawmill
                    and cement store were erected, and a substantial jetty around 2,100 feet (640 m) long was started
                    early
                    in 1883, and extended
                    as necessary, and sidings were built to bring railway vehicles among the shops, and cranes set up to
                    allow the loading and
                    movement of material delivered by rail.
                    <br>
                    In April 1883, construction of a landing stage at Inchgarvie commenced. Extant buildings, including
                    fortifications built
                    in the 15th century, were roofed over to increase the available space, and the rock at the west of
                    the
                    island was cut down
                    to a level 7 feet (2.1 m) above high water, and a seawall was built to protect against large waves.
                    In
                    1884 a compulsory
                    purchase order was obtained for the island, as it was found that previously available area enclosed
                    by
                    the four piers of the
                    bridge was insufficient for the storage of materials. Iron staging reinforced wood in heavily used
                    areas
                    was put up over
                    the island, eventually covering around 10,000 square yards (8,400 m2) and using over 1,000 tonnes
                    (980
                    long tons; 1,100 short
                    tons) of iron.
                    <br>
                    The old coastguard station at the Fife end had to be removed to make way for the north-east
                    pier.[48]
                    The rocky shore was
                    levelled to a height of 7 feet (2.1 m) above high water to make way for plant and materials, and
                    huts
                    and other facilities
                    for workmen were set up further inland.

                    The bridge spans the Forth between the villages of South Queensferry and North Queensferry and has a
                    total length of 8,094
                    feet (2,467 m)[1] with the double track elevated 150 feet (45.72 m) above the water level at high
                    tide.
                    It consists of two
                    main spans of 1,700 feet (518.16 m), two side spans of 680 ft (207.3 m), and 15 approach spans of
                    168 ft
                    (51.2 m). Each main
                    span consists of two 680 ft (207.3 m) cantilever arms supporting a central 350 feet (106.7 m) span
                    truss. The weight of the
                    bridge superstructure was 50,513 long tons (51,324 t), including the 6.5 million rivets used.[23]
                    The
                    bridge also used 640,000
                    cubic feet (18,122 m3) of granite.
                    <br>
                    The three great four-tower cantilever structures are 361 feet (110.03 m) tall,[1] each tower resting
                    on
                    a separate granite
                    pier. These were constructed using 70 ft (21 m) diameter caissons; those for the north cantilever
                    and
                    two on the small
                    uninhabited island of Inchgarvie acted as cofferdams, while the remaining two on Inchgarvie and
                    those
                    for the south cantilever,
                    where the river bed was 91 ft (28 m) below high-water level, used compressed air to keep water out
                    of
                    the working chamber at the
                    base.

                    Senior engineer Charles Alton Ellis, collaborating remotely with Moisseiff, was the principal
                    engineer
                    of the project. Moisseiff produced the basic structural design, introducing his "deflection theory"
                    by which a thin, flexible roadway would flex in the wind, greatly reducing stress by transmitting
                    forces
                    via suspension cables to the bridge towers. Although the Golden Gate Bridge design has proved sound,
                    a later Moisseiff design, the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, collapsed in a strong windstorm soon
                    after
                    it was completed, because of an unexpected aeroelastic flutter. Ellis was also tasked with designing
                    a "bridge within a bridge" in the southern abutment, to avoid the need to demolish Fort Point, a
                    pre–Civil War masonry fortification viewed, even then, as worthy of historic preservation. He penned
                    a
                    graceful steel arch spanning the fort and carrying the roadway to the bridge's southern anchorage.
                    <br>
                    Ellis was a Greek scholar and mathematician who at one time was a University of Illinois professor
                    of
                    engineering despite having no engineering degree. He eventually earned a degree in civil engineering
                    from the University of Illinois prior to designing the Golden Gate Bridge and spent the last twelve
                    years of his career as a professor at Purdue University. He became an expert in structural design,
                    writing the standard textbook of the time. Ellis did much of the technical and theoretical work that
                    built the bridge, but he received none of the credit in his lifetime. In November 1931, Strauss
                    fired
                    Ellis and replaced him with a former subordinate, Clifford Paine, ostensibly for wasting too much
                    money
                    sending telegrams back and forth to Moisseiff. Ellis, obsessed with the project and unable to find
                    work elsewhere during the Depression, continued working 70 hours per week on an unpaid basis,
                    eventually
                    turning in ten volumes of hand calculations.

                    With an eye toward self-promotion and posterity, Strauss downplayed the contributions of his
                    collaborators who, despite receiving little recognition or compensation,[23] are largely responsible
                    for
                    the final form of the bridge. He succeeded in having himself credited as the person most responsible
                    for
                    the design and vision of the bridge. Only much later were the contributions of the others on the
                    design team properly appreciated. In May 2007, the Golden Gate Bridge District issued a formal
                    report on 70 years of stewardship of the famous bridge and decided to give Ellis major credit for
                    the
                    design of the bridge.
