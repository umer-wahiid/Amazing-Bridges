                    the Brooklyn Bridge was the first fixed crossing of the East River.<img src="IMAGES/BROOKLYN 1.jpg"
                        style="height: 250px;width: 350px; float: right;padding: 15px">
                    It was also the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time of its opening,
                    with a main span of 1,595.5 feet (486.3 m) and a deck 127 ft (38.7 m) above mean high water.
                    The span was originally called the New York and Brooklyn Bridge or the East River Bridge but was
                    officially renamed the Brooklyn Bridge in 1915.
                    Proposals for a bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn were first made in the early 19th century,
                    which eventually led to the construction of the current span, designed by John A. Roebling.
                    The project's chief engineer, his son Washington Roebling, contributed further design work,
                    assisted by the latter's wife, Emily Warren Roebling. Construction started in 1870,
                    with the Tammany Hall-controlled New York Bridge Company overseeing construction,
                    although numerous controversies and the novelty of the design prolonged the project over thirteen
                    years.
                    Since opening, the Brooklyn Bridge has undergone several reconfigurations,
                    having carried horse-drawn vehicles and elevated railway lines until 1950.

                Proposals for a bridge between the then-separate cities of Brooklyn and New York had been
                suggested
                as early as 1800. At the time, the only travel between the two cities was by a number of ferry lines.
                Engineers presented various designs, such as chain or link bridges, though these were never built
                because of the
                difficulties of constructing a high enough fixed-span bridge across the extremely busy East River.
                <br>
                There were also proposals for tunnels under the East River,
                but these were considered prohibitively expensive. The current Brooklyn Bridge was conceived by German
                immigrant
                John Augustus Roebling in 1852. He had previously designed and constructed shorter suspension bridges,
                such as Roebling's Delaware Aqueduct in Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania, and the John A. Roebling Suspension
                Bridge between
                Cincinnati, Ohio, and Covington, Kentucky.In February 1867, the New York State Senate passed a bill that
                allowed the
                construction of a suspension bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan.
                <br>
                Two months later, the New York and Brooklyn Bridge Company was incorporated with a board of directors
                (later converted
                to a board of trustees). There were twenty trustees in total: eight each appointed by the mayors of New
                York
                and Brooklyn, as well as the mayors of each city and the auditor and comptroller of Brooklyn. The
                company was tasked
                with constructing what was then known as the New York and Brooklyn Bridge.

                        style="height: 250px;width: 350px;float: right;padding: 15px">Construction of the Brooklyn
                    Bridge
                    began on January 2,
                    1870. The first work entailed the construction of two caissons, upon which the suspension towers
                    would
                    be built.
                    The Brooklyn side's caisson was built at the Webb & Bell shipyard in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and was
                    launched into the
                    river on March 19, 1870. Compressed air was pumped into the caisson, and workers entered the space
                    to
                    dig the
                    sediment until it sank to the bedrock. As one sixteen-year-old from Ireland, Frank Harris, described
                    the
                    fearful experience
                    <br>
                    The six of us were working naked to the waist in the small iron chamber with the temperature of
                    about 80
                    degrees Fahrenheit:
                    In five minutes the sweat was pouring from us, and all the while we were standing in icy water that
                    was
                    only kept from rising
                    by the terrific pressure. No wonder the headaches were blinding.
                    <br>
                    Once the caisson had reached the desired depth, it was to be filled in with vertical brick piers and
                    concrete.
                    However, due to the unexpectedly high concentration of large boulders atop the riverbed, the
                    Brooklyn
                    caisson
                    took several months to sink to the desired depth. Furthermore, in December 1870, its timber roof
                    caught
                    fire,
                    delaying construction further. The "Great Blowout", as the fire was called, delayed construction for
                    several
                    months, since the holes in the caisson had to be repaired. On March 6, 1871, the repairs were
                    finished,
                    and the
                    caisson had reached its final depth of 44.5 feet (13.6 m); it was filled with concrete five days
                    later.
                    Overall,
                    about 264 individuals were estimated to have worked in the caisson every day, but because of high
                    worker
                    turnover,
                    the final total was thought to be about 2,500 men in total. In spite of this, only a few workers
                    were
                    paralyzed.
                    At its final depth, the caisson's air pressure was 21 pounds per square inch (140 kPa).
                    <br>
                    The Manhattan side's caisson was the next structure to be built. To ensure that it would not catch
                    fire
                    like its
                    counterpart had, the Manhattan caisson was lined with fireproof plate iron. It was launched from
                    Webb &
                    Bell's
                    shipyard on May 11, 1871, and maneuvered into place that September. Due to the extreme underwater
                    air pressure inside the much deeper Manhattan caisson, many workers became sick with "the
                    bends"—decompression
                    sickness—during this work, despite the incorporation of airlocks (which were believed to help with
                    decompression
                    sickness at the time). This condition was unknown at the time and was first called "caisson disease"
                    by
                    the
                    project physician, Andrew Smith. Between January 25 and May 31, 1872, Smith treated 110 cases of
                    decompression
                    sickness, while three workers died from the disease. When iron probes underneath the Manhattan
                    caisson
                    found the bedrock
                    to be even deeper than expected, Washington Roebling halted construction due to the increased risk
                    of
                    decompression sickness.
                    After the Manhattan caisson reached a depth of 78.5 feet (23.9 m) with an air pressure of 35 pounds
                    per
                    square inch
                    (240 kPa), Washington deemed the sandy subsoil overlying the bedrock 30 feet (9.1 m) beneath to be
                    sufficiently firm, and
                    subsequently infilled the caisson with concrete in July 1872.
                    <br>
                    Washington Roebling himself suffered a paralyzing injury as a result of caisson disease shortly
                    after
                    ground was broken for
                    the Brooklyn tower foundation. His debilitating condition left him unable to supervise the
                    construction
                    in person,
                    so he designed the caissons and other equipment from his apartment, directing "the completion of the
                    bridge through a telescope
                    from his bedroom. His wife Emily Warren Roebling not only provided written communications between
                    her
                    husband and the
                    engineers on site, but also understood mathematics, calculations of catenary curves, strengths of
                    materials, bridge
                    specifications, and the intricacies of cable construction. She spent the next 11 years helping
                    supervise
                    the bridge's
                    construction, taking over much of the chief engineer's duties, including day-to-day supervision and
                    project management.

                <p class="para">
                    Strauss was the chief engineer in charge of the overall design and construction of the bridge
                    project. However, because he had little understanding or experience with cable-suspension
                    designs, responsibility for much of the engineering and architecture fell on other experts.
                    Strauss's initial design proposal (two double cantilever spans linked by a central suspension
                    segment)
                    was unacceptable from a visual standpoint. The final graceful suspension design was conceived and
                    championed by Leon Moisseiff, the engineer of the Manhattan Bridge in New York City.
                    <br>
                    Irving Morrow, a relatively unknown residential architect, designed the overall shape of the bridge
                    towers, the lighting scheme, and Art Deco elements, such as the tower decorations, streetlights,
                    railing, and walkways. The famous International Orange color was Morrow's personal selection,
                    winning
                    out over other possibilities, including the US Navy's suggestion that it be painted with black and
                    yellow stripes to ensure visibility by passing ships.
                    <br>
                    Senior engineer Charles Alton Ellis, collaborating remotely with Moisseiff, was the principal
                    engineer
                    of the project. Moisseiff produced the basic structural design, introducing his "deflection theory"
                    by which a thin, flexible roadway would flex in the wind, greatly reducing stress by transmitting
                    forces
                    via suspension cables to the bridge towers. Although the Golden Gate Bridge design has proved sound,
                    a later Moisseiff design, the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, collapsed in a strong windstorm soon
                    after
                    it was completed, because of an unexpected aeroelastic flutter. Ellis was also tasked with designing
                    a "bridge within a bridge" in the southern abutment, to avoid the need to demolish Fort Point, a
                    pre–Civil War masonry fortification viewed, even then, as worthy of historic preservation. He penned
                    a
                    graceful steel arch spanning the fort and carrying the roadway to the bridge's southern anchorage.
                    <br>
                    Ellis was a Greek scholar and mathematician who at one time was a University of Illinois professor
                    of
                    engineering despite having no engineering degree. He eventually earned a degree in civil engineering
                    from the University of Illinois prior to designing the Golden Gate Bridge and spent the last twelve
                    years of his career as a professor at Purdue University. He became an expert in structural design,
                    writing the standard textbook of the time. Ellis did much of the technical and theoretical work that
                    built the bridge, but he received none of the credit in his lifetime. In November 1931, Strauss
                    fired
                    Ellis and replaced him with a former subordinate, Clifford Paine, ostensibly for wasting too much
                    money
                    sending telegrams back and forth to Moisseiff. Ellis, obsessed with the project and unable to find
                    work elsewhere during the Depression, continued working 70 hours per week on an unpaid basis,
                    eventually
                    turning in ten volumes of hand calculations.
                    <br>
                    With an eye toward self-promotion and posterity, Strauss downplayed the contributions of his
                    collaborators who, despite receiving little recognition or compensation,[23] are largely responsible
                    for
                    the final form of the bridge. He succeeded in having himself credited as the person most responsible
                    for
                    the design and vision of the bridge. Only much later were the contributions of the others on the
                    design team properly appreciated. In May 2007, the Golden Gate Bridge District issued a formal
                    report on 70 years of stewardship of the famous bridge and decided to give Ellis major credit for
                    the
                    design of the bridge.
