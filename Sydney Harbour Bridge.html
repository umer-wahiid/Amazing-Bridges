                    Opera House is widely regarded as an iconic image of Sydney, and of Australia itself. Nicknamed "The
                    Coathanger"
                    because of its arch-based design, the bridge carries rail, vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian

                    Under the direction of John Bradfield of the New South Wales Department of Public Works, the bridge
                    was
                    designed
                    and built by British firm Dorman Long of Middlesbrough (who based the design on their 1928 Tyne
                    Bridge
                    in Newcastle
                    upon Tyne) and opened in 1932. The bridge's general design, which Bradfield tasked the NSW
                    Department of
                    Public
                    Works with producing, was a rough copy of the Hell Gate Bridge in New York City. This general design
                    document, however,
                    did not form any part of the request for tender, which remained sufficiently broad as to allow
                    cantilever (Bradfield's
                    original preference) and even suspension bridge proposals. The design chosen from the tender
                    responses
                    was original work
                    created by Dorman Long, who leveraged some of the design from their own Tyne Bridge which, though
                    superficially similar,
                    does not share the graceful flares at the ends of each arch which make the harbour bridge so
                    distinctive. It is the
                    eighth longest spanning-arch bridge in the world and the tallest steel arch bridge, measuring 134 m
                    (440
                    ft) from top to
                    water level. It was also the world's widest long-span bridge, at 48.8 m (160 ft) wide, until
                    construction of the new Port
                    Mann Bridge in Vancouver was completed in 2012.

                There had been plans to build a bridge as early as 1815, when convict and noted architect
                Francis Greenway
                reputedly proposed to Governor Lachlan Macquarie that a bridge be built from the northern to the
                southern shore of the
                harbour. In 1825, Greenway wrote a letter to the then "The Australian" newspaper stating that such a
                bridge would
                "give an idea of strength and magnificence that would reflect credit and glory on the colony and the
                Mother Country".
                <br>
                Nothing came of Greenway's suggestions, but the idea remained alive, and many further suggestions were
                made during the
                nineteenth century. In 1840, naval architect Robert Brindley proposed that a floating bridge be built.
                Engineer Peter
                Henderson produced one of the earliest known drawings of a bridge across the harbour around 1857. A
                suggestion for a truss
                bridge was made in 1879, and in 1880 a high-level bridge estimated at £850,000 was proposed.
                <br>
                In 1900, the Lyne government committed to building a new Central railway station and organised a
                worldwide competition for the
                design and construction of a harbour bridge. Local engineer Norman Selfe submitted a design for a
                suspension bridge and won the
                second prize of £500. In 1902, when the outcome of the first competition became mired in controversy,
                Selfe won a second
                competition outright, with a design for a steel cantilever bridge. The selection board were unanimous,
                commenting that,
                "The structural lines are correct and in true proportion, and... the outline is graceful". However due
                to an economic
                downturn and a change of government at the 1904 NSW State election construction never began.

                        style="height: 250px;width: 350px;float: right;padding: 15px">Bradfield visited the site
                    sporadically throughout the eight
                    years it took Dorman Long to complete the bridge. Despite having originally championed a cantilever
                    construction and the
                    fact that his own arched general design was used in neither the tender process nor as input to the
                    detailed
                    design specification (and was anyway a rough copy of the Devil's Gate bridge produced by the NSW
                    Works
                    Department),
                    Bradfield subsequently attempted to claim personal credit for Dorman Long's design. This led to a
                    bitter
                    argument, with
                    Dorman Long maintaining that instructing other people to produce a copy of an existing design in a
                    document not subsequently
                    used to specify the final construction did not constitute personal design input on Bradfield's part.
                    This friction ultimately
                    led to a large contemporary brass plaque being bolted very tightly to the side of one of the granite
                    columns of the bridge to
                    makes things clear.
                    <br>
                    The official ceremony to mark the "turning of the first sod" occurred on 28 July 1923, on the spot
                    at
                    Milsons Point on the
                    north shore where two workshops to assist in building the bridge were to be constructed.
                    <br>
                    An estimated 469 buildings on the north shore, both private homes and commercial operations, were
                    demolished to allow
                    construction to proceed, with little or no compensation being paid. Work on the bridge itself
                    commenced
                    with the construction
                    of approaches and approach spans, and by September 1926 concrete piers to support the approach spans
                    were in place on each side
                    of the harbour.
                    <br>
                    As construction of the approaches took place, work was also started on preparing the foundations
                    required to support the
                    enormous weight of the arch and loadings. Concrete and granite faced abutment towers were
                    constructed,
                    with the angled
                    foundations built into their sides.
                    Once work had progressed sufficiently on the support structures, a giant "creeper crane" was erected
                    on
                    each side of the
                    harbour. These cranes were fitted with a cradle, and then used to hoist men and materials into
                    position
                    to allow for
                    erection of the steelwork. To stabilise works while building the arches, tunnels were excavated on
                    each
                    shore with steel
                    cables passed through them and then fixed to the upper sections of each half-arch to stop them
                    collapsing as they extended
                    outwards.
                    <br>
                    Arch construction itself began on 26 October 1928. The southern end of the bridge was worked on
                    ahead of
                    the northern end, to detect
                    any errors and to help with alignment. The cranes would "creep" along the arches as they were
                    constructed, eventually meeting up in
                    the middle. In less than two years, on Tuesday, 19 August 1930, the two halves of the arch touched
                    for
                    the first time. Workers riveted
                    both top and bottom sections of the arch together, and the arch became self-supporting, allowing the
                    support cables to be removed. On
                    20 August 1930 the joining of the arches was celebrated by flying the flags of Australia and the
                    United
                    Kingdom from the jibs of the
                    creeper cranes.

                    Strauss was the chief engineer in charge of the overall design and construction of the bridge
                    project. However, because he had little understanding or experience with cable-suspension
                    designs, responsibility for much of the engineering and architecture fell on other experts.
                    Strauss's initial design proposal (two double cantilever spans linked by a central suspension
                    segment)
                    was unacceptable from a visual standpoint. The final graceful suspension design was conceived and
                    championed by Leon Moisseiff, the engineer of the Manhattan Bridge in New York City.
                    <br>
                    Irving Morrow, a relatively unknown residential architect, designed the overall shape of the bridge
                    towers, the lighting scheme, and Art Deco elements, such as the tower decorations, streetlights,
                    railing, and walkways. The famous International Orange color was Morrow's personal selection,
                    winning
                    out over other possibilities, including the US Navy's suggestion that it be painted with black and
                    yellow stripes to ensure visibility by passing ships.
                    <br>
                    Senior engineer Charles Alton Ellis, collaborating remotely with Moisseiff, was the principal
                    engineer
                    of the project. Moisseiff produced the basic structural design, introducing his "deflection theory"
                    by which a thin, flexible roadway would flex in the wind, greatly reducing stress by transmitting
                    forces
                    via suspension cables to the bridge towers. Although the Golden Gate Bridge design has proved sound,
                    a later Moisseiff design, the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, collapsed in a strong windstorm soon
                    after
                    it was completed, because of an unexpected aeroelastic flutter. Ellis was also tasked with designing
                    a "bridge within a bridge" in the southern abutment, to avoid the need to demolish Fort Point, a
                    pre–Civil War masonry fortification viewed, even then, as worthy of historic preservation. He penned
                    a
                    graceful steel arch spanning the fort and carrying the roadway to the bridge's southern anchorage.
                    <br>
                    Ellis was a Greek scholar and mathematician who at one time was a University of Illinois professor
                    of
                    engineering despite having no engineering degree. He eventually earned a degree in civil engineering
                    from the University of Illinois prior to designing the Golden Gate Bridge and spent the last twelve
                    years of his career as a professor at Purdue University. He became an expert in structural design,
                    writing the standard textbook of the time. Ellis did much of the technical and theoretical work that
                    built the bridge, but he received none of the credit in his lifetime. In November 1931, Strauss
                    fired
                    Ellis and replaced him with a former subordinate, Clifford Paine, ostensibly for wasting too much
                    money
                    sending telegrams back and forth to Moisseiff. Ellis, obsessed with the project and unable to find
                    work elsewhere during the Depression, continued working 70 hours per week on an unpaid basis,
                    eventually
                    turning in ten volumes of hand calculations.
                    <br>
                    With an eye toward self-promotion and posterity, Strauss downplayed the contributions of his
                    collaborators who, despite receiving little recognition or compensation,[23] are largely responsible
                    for
                    the final form of the bridge. He succeeded in having himself credited as the person most responsible
                    for
                    the design and vision of the bridge. Only much later were the contributions of the others on the
