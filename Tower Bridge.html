                    and 1894, designed by
                    Horace Jones and engineered by John Wolfe Barry. The bridge crosses the River Thames close to the
                    Tower
                    of London and is one
                    of five London bridges owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust founded
                    in
                    1282. The bridge was
                    constructed to give better access to the East End of London, which had expanded its commercial
                    potential
                    in the 19th century.
                    The bridge was opened by Edward, Prince of Wales and Alexandra, Princess of Wales in 1894.<img

                    The bridge is 800 feet (240 m) in length and consists of two 213-foot (65 m) bridge towers connected
                    at
                    the upper level
                    by two horizontal walkways, and a central pair of bascules that can open to allow shipping.
                    Originally
                    hydraulically
                    powered, the operating mechanism was converted to an electro-hydraulic system in 1972. The bridge is
                    part of the A100
                    London Inner Ring Road and thus the boundary of the London congestion charge zone, and remains an
                    important traffic route
                    with 40,000 crossings every day. The bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and
                    pedestrians,
                    whereas the
                    bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge
                    Exhibition.

                In the late 19th century, commercial development in the East End of London increased,
                leading to demand for a
                new river crossing downstream of London Bridge. A traditional fixed bridge at street level could not be
                built because it
                would cut off access by sailing ships to the port facilities in the Pool of London between London Bridge
                and the Tower of
                London.
                <br>
                A Special Bridge or Subway Committee chaired by Sir Albert Joseph Altman was formed in 1877 to find a
                solution.
                More than fifty designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette, which
                was rejected because of
                a lack of sufficient headroom. A design was not approved until 1884, when it was decided to build a
                bascule bridge.
                Sir John Wolfe Barry was appointed engineer and Sir Horace Jones the architect (who was also one of the
                judges).
                <br>
                An Act of Parliament authorising construction was passed in 1885. It specified that the opening span
                would provide a clear
                width of 200 feet (61 m) and headroom of 135 feet (41 m). The design had to be in a Gothic style.[5]
                Construction was funded
                by the Bridge House Estates, a charity established in 1282 for maintenance of London Bridge that
                subsequently expanded to cover
                Tower Bridge, Blackfriars Bridge, Southwark Bridge and the Millennium Bridge.

                Sir John Wolfe Barry was appointed engineer and Sir Horace Jones the architect (who was also one of the

                    by the Prince of Wales on 21 June, and took eight years. Major contractors included Sir John Jackson
                    (foundations),
                    Armstrong, Mitchell and Company (hydraulics), William Webster, and Sir William Arrol & Co. 432

                    Two piers, containing over 70,000 long tons (78,400 short tons; 71,123 t) of concrete, were sunk
                    into
                    the riverbed to
                    support the construction. More than 11,000 long tons (12,320 short tons; 11,177 t) of steel were
                    used in
                    the framework

                    underlying steelwork.
                    <br>
                    Jones died in 1887, and George D. Stevenson took over the project. Stevenson replaced Jones's
                    original
                    brick façade with
                    the more ornate Victorian Gothic style, which made the bridge a distinctive landmark, and was
                    intended
                    to harmonise the bridge
                    with the nearby Tower of London. The total cost of construction was £1,184,000 (equivalent to £138
                    million in
                    2020).

                    Tower Bridge was officially opened on 30 June 1894 by the Prince and Princess of Wales. The opening
                    ceremony was
                    attended by the Lord Chamberlain, the Lord Carrington and the Home Secretary, H. H. Asquith. An Act
                    of
                    Parliament
                    stipulated that a tug boat should be on station to assist vessels in danger when crossing the
                    bridge, a
                    requirement that
                    remained in place until the 1960s.
                    The bridge connected Iron Gate, on the north bank of the river, with Horselydown Lane, on the south
                    –
                    now known as Tower
                    Bridge Approach and Tower Bridge Road, respectively.[13] Until the bridge was opened, the Tower
                    Subway –
                    0.25 mi (400 m) to
                    the west – was the shortest way to cross the river from Tower Hill to Tooley Street in Southwark.
                    Opened
                    in 1870, Tower Subway
                    was among the world's earliest underground ("tube") railways, but it closed after just three months
                    and
                    was reopened as a tolled
                    pedestrian foot tunnel. Once Tower Bridge was open, the majority of foot traffic transferred to
                    using
                    the bridge, as there was no
                    toll to cross. Having lost most of its income, the tunnel was closed in 1898.
                    <br>
                    During the Second World War, Tower Bridge was seen as a major transport link to the Port of London,
                    and
                    consequently was a
                    target for enemy action. In 1940, the high-level span took a direct hit, severing the hydraulic
                    mechanism and taking the
                    bridge out of action. In April 1941, a parachute mine exploded close to the bridge, causing serious
                    damage to the bascule,
                    towers and engine room. In 1942, a third engine was installed in case the existing ones were damaged
                    by
                    enemy action. It
                    was a 150 hp horizontal cross-compound engine, built by Vickers Armstrong Ltd. at their Elswick
                    works in
                    Newcastle upon Tyne.
                    It was fitted with a flywheel having a 9-foot (2.7 m) diameter and weighing 9 tons, and was governed
                    to
                    a speed of 30 rpm.
                    The engine became redundant when the rest of the system was modernised in 1974, and was donated to
                    the
                    Forncett Industrial
                    Steam Museum by the City of London Corporation.
                    <br>
                    The southern section of the bridge, in the London Borough of Southwark, was Grade I listed on 6
                    December
                    1949.[25] The
                    remainder of the bridge, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, was listed on 27 September
                    1973.[26] In
                    1974, the original
                    operating mechanism was largely replaced by a new electro-hydraulic drive system, designed by BHA
                    Cromwell House, with the
                    original final pinions driven by modern hydraulic motors.

                <p class="para">
                    Strauss was the chief engineer in charge of the overall design and construction of the bridge
                    project. However, because he had little understanding or experience with cable-suspension
                    designs, responsibility for much of the engineering and architecture fell on other experts.
                    Strauss's initial design proposal (two double cantilever spans linked by a central suspension
                    segment)
                    was unacceptable from a visual standpoint. The final graceful suspension design was conceived and
                    championed by Leon Moisseiff, the engineer of the Manhattan Bridge in New York City.
                    <br>
                    Irving Morrow, a relatively unknown residential architect, designed the overall shape of the bridge
                    towers, the lighting scheme, and Art Deco elements, such as the tower decorations, streetlights,
                    railing, and walkways. The famous International Orange color was Morrow's personal selection,
                    winning
                    out over other possibilities, including the US Navy's suggestion that it be painted with black and
                    yellow stripes to ensure visibility by passing ships.
                    <br>
                    Senior engineer Charles Alton Ellis, collaborating remotely with Moisseiff, was the principal
                    engineer
                    of the project. Moisseiff produced the basic structural design, introducing his "deflection theory"
                    by which a thin, flexible roadway would flex in the wind, greatly reducing stress by transmitting
                    forces
                    via suspension cables to the bridge towers. Although the Golden Gate Bridge design has proved sound,
                    a later Moisseiff design, the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, collapsed in a strong windstorm soon
                    after
                    it was completed, because of an unexpected aeroelastic flutter. Ellis was also tasked with designing
                    a "bridge within a bridge" in the southern abutment, to avoid the need to demolish Fort Point, a
                    pre–Civil War masonry fortification viewed, even then, as worthy of historic preservation. He penned
                    a
                    graceful steel arch spanning the fort and carrying the roadway to the bridge's southern anchorage.
                    <br>
                    Ellis was a Greek scholar and mathematician who at one time was a University of Illinois professor
                    of
                    engineering despite having no engineering degree. He eventually earned a degree in civil engineering
                    from the University of Illinois prior to designing the Golden Gate Bridge and spent the last twelve
                    years of his career as a professor at Purdue University. He became an expert in structural design,
                    writing the standard textbook of the time. Ellis did much of the technical and theoretical work that
                    built the bridge, but he received none of the credit in his lifetime. In November 1931, Strauss
                    fired
                    Ellis and replaced him with a former subordinate, Clifford Paine, ostensibly for wasting too much
                    money
                    sending telegrams back and forth to Moisseiff. Ellis, obsessed with the project and unable to find
                    work elsewhere during the Depression, continued working 70 hours per week on an unpaid basis,
                    eventually
                    turning in ten volumes of hand calculations.
                    <br>
                    With an eye toward self-promotion and posterity, Strauss downplayed the contributions of his
                    collaborators who, despite receiving little recognition or compensation,[23] are largely responsible
                    for
                    the final form of the bridge. He succeeded in having himself credited as the person most responsible
                    for
                    the design and vision of the bridge. Only much later were the contributions of the others on the
                    design team properly appreciated. In May 2007, the Golden Gate Bridge District issued a formal
                    report on 70 years of stewardship of the famous bridge and decided to give Ellis major credit for
                    the
                    design of the bridge.
